# World Generation with WFC

## Description
This project implements a world generation algorithm using the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) technique. It allows you to generate and visualize 2D worlds with different tile colors, including land, coastal water, water, and grass.
Additionally, it provides the following features:

Interactive Painting: Users can paint the map with different tile colors to customize the world's layout according to their preferences.

Map Loading and Saving: The application supports loading and saving maps as images, allowing users to preserve and share their generated worlds.
